    "In this lecture, you learned about how the Markov decision process (MDP) framework can be extended to allow uncertainty about the states. This can be used to model a wide range of decision-making problems where there is uncertainty or noise associated with the state of the world.\n",

    "We considered the example of the random dot motion discrimination task, where a subject must indicate the direction in which the majority of dots are moving. In this assignment, you will solve a two-stage formulation of this task, where the decision-maker can either make an immediate decision (i.e., at the first stage) on the basis of initial information, or choose to wait and gather further information before making their choice (i.e., at the second stage). The complete description of the problem can be found in the lecture slides and also in the original paper: http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~dayan/papers/NDM002wc.pdf\n",
